# NodeDHTML ver. 0.1
In development phase, avoid using this in production environments.

NodeDHTML is a project that allows emulating the development and execution environment of the classic ASP (Active Server Pages) within the Node.js ecosystem. By combining the familiarity of ASP with the powerful Node.js platform, NodeDHTML provides a way to create dynamic and interactive web applications. With support for request processing, session management, cookie handling, and ASP script analysis, this solution enables developers to migrate or create new applications using the familiar syntax of ASP, while benefiting from the performance, scalability, and extensive availability of Node.js modules.

With NodeASP, the essence of classic ASP is explored, harnessing the full potential of the modern Node.js platform, all within a unified development experience.
